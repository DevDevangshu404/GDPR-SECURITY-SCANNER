# GDPR Compliance Checker with OWASP ZAP and Nmap Integration

### Check more about it on my website: https://www.devangshumazumder.com/projects/content/gdpr-nmap/gdpr

## Description

This **GDPR Compliance Checker** helps websites and companies ensure their compliance with GDPR regulations and enhances their security posture by identifying potential vulnerabilities. It scans for cookies, checks transmission security, analyzes third-party scripts, assesses accessibility, and integrates **OWASP ZAP** and **Nmap** for in-depth security scans.

### Key Features:
***
- **Cookie Classification**: Categorizes cookies as strictly necessary, performance-related, or tracking cookies and checks their compliance with GDPR.
- **Transmission Security**: Verifies whether a website uses HTTPS and checks for secure SSL/TLS transmission.
- **XSS Vulnerability Detection**: Detects potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the websiteâ€™s HTML code.
- **Third-Party Script Analysis**: Identifies third-party scripts, such as Google Analytics and Facebook tracking, and checks for compliance with GDPR.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Assesses the website's accessibility by checking for alt text and form labels, ensuring compliance with WCAG.
- **OWASP ZAP Security Scanning**: Integrates with **OWASP ZAP** for identifying vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and more.
- **Nmap Network Scan**: Uses **Nmap** to scan for open ports and services, identifying network vulnerabilities.

## GDPR Compliance

*  1.	Data Protection: Ensures compliance with GDPR regulations by categorizing cookies, checking privacy policies, and analyzing third-party
        scripts.
*	2.	Security Scanning: Identifies potential security threats such as SQL injection, open ports, and XSS vulnerabilities, reducing the risk
        of cyberattacks.
*	3.	Accessibility: Assesses accessibility based on WCAG standards, ensuring your website meets regulatory requirements.
*	4.	Comprehensive Reporting: Provides detailed reports that help improve website security and data protection strategies.
